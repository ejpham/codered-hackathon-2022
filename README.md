Repository for Team Waku Waku CodeRED Odyssey Hackathon 2022

This repository contains the files for our website, a submission for the CodeRED Odyssey 2022 Hackathon.

The challenge that we decided to pursue was the one provided by ConocoPhillips, where we create a solution that analyzes and/or displays oil and gas production in the United States in an informative way.

Our website displays a GeoChart provided by the Google Charts API that contains the oil production amount per state. The data we receive is based off of the U.S. Energy Information Administration Petroleum API.

We believe that this is a very user-friendly way to provide data to people looking for this information.
